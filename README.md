My Personal Portfolio Website
This is a professional portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. Built as a fast and modern single-page application (SPA), it provides a comprehensive and interactive digital resume for potential employers and collaborators.

Project Overview
The website offers a seamless and interactive user experience. It's built with a strong focus on clean, modular code and a modern, responsive design that looks great on any device.

Key Features
Interactive UI: The user interface is crafted to be clean, modern, and highly interactive, ensuring smooth navigation across all sections of the site.

Serverless Contact Form: The site includes a fully functional contact form powered by a secure serverless function, which handles email sending without the need for a dedicated backend server.

Responsive Design: The entire layout and all components are built to be fully responsive, guaranteeing an optimal viewing experience on various devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

Technology Stack
The application is built using a modern and efficient technology stack:

Frontend
React: Used for its component-based architecture, which allows for a modular and maintainable codebase.

JavaScript: Powers the dynamic functionality and client-side logic.

HTML & CSS: Used for the fundamental structure and custom styling of the user interface.

Backend
Serverless Function: A lightweight backend is used to securely process and send data from the contact form, leveraging a platform like Vercel or AWS Lambda.
